<Yahya Azami>
Active Bidding Page: https://yazami.github.io/

*Feedback*
Instead of bidding the whole amount, the distributor should be able to bid for the amount of goods that is available in their inventory.
Whatever in the catalogue page (inventory), should be the same as the inventory in catalogue

Need the back end webpage for the lowest bid: confirm/reject
If they're accepted: They will receive email saying they win the bid and they have to deliver (amount) of goods to this address by certain date.
